		<h2>How to start a new chat</h2>
		
		<div class="content">
			<p>Simple! Just append <code>/chat/<strong>roomname</strong></code> to the current URL and you will get a chatroom called <code>roomname</code>. Replace <code>roomname</code> with an arbitrary text.</p>
			<p>Or use <a href="/chat/{{.RandomChat}}">this random chatroom</a>.</p>
			<p>To invite other people to your new shiny chatroom, just send them the URL.</p>

		<h2>Throwaway chatrooms</h2>
		
		<div class="content">
			<p>All created chatrooms are throwaway chatrooms. When the last one leaves the room, it will be gone until someone visits the chat again.</p>
			<p>Nothing in the chat will be stored permanently on our servers.</p>
			<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Keep in mind that this service does <em>not</em> use encryption. So please, don't share sensible data that might get you into trouble, there are much better tools for that (XMPP+OTR or GPG, for example).</p>
